This is an implementation for Greedy Best First Search and A* algorithms
2017 by Thuy Do
Using Java with Netbeans IDE 8.2
The 2 algorithm are to find solution path which is the moves from the Initial State to the Goal State
+ Initial State: Cursor at the first node of the graph(node 0)
+ Goal State: Cursor at the last node of graph (node n-1)
Output file:
+ Output The first line is a path from node 0 to the last node searched by Greedy Search.
+ The second line is a path from node 0 to the last node searched by A* Search
The input file name and the output file name for the 2 algorithms is assigned in the main function
pa1.in is the sample input file that the algorithms tested and resulted in the output file "pa1.out"
passed_inp1.txt is a sample input file that the algorithms tested and resulted in the output file "out1.txt"
similarly, passed_inp2.txt is the sample input from textbook (Rumania Problem) => out2.txt
passed_inp3.txt is the sample with 1002 nodes and 5205 edges => out3.txt
